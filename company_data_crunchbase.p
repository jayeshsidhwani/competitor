V3DR Group (3D Retail Group) aims to revolutionize the way that retail organizations advertise their products and differentiate their brand in increasingly competitive markets. The problem with existing advertising channels is that they lack novelty, given the mind-blowing rate that technology is advancing. By innovatively combining existing 3D scanning and holography devices, 3DR Group will be able to transform physical products into 3D holograms that can be displayed in stores, malls, or even on a company\u2019s website.\u000aMarket research shows that there are a number of 3D imaging and scanning companies that already exist (e.g. Direct Dimensions). These \u201ccompetitors\u201d address a number of markets, such as industrial, mechanical, and architectural 3D imaging, but fail to address the retail market. This allows 3DR Group to be a first-mover into an undiscovered corner of an industry that is expected to grow to about $10 billion by 2018, according to a number of sources.

VWindoWin is a Hamburg, Germany-based startup company founded by retail advertising and communication veteran Marc Schwieger to develop a mobile shopping concept and application called wynsh. It is run by entrepreneur and eCommerce veteran Sascha Rowold and ex-BCG management consultant and retail expert Christoph Hilberath. \u000a\u000awynsh is a smartphone shopping app (available for iOS and Android phones) which helps retail customers get an individual deal on items they choose themselves. By taking and uploading a picture with their smartphone of a product they favor in a brick and mortar retail store, shoppers playfully initiate an individual deal with a retailer at the same time creating a bond with that product.  \u000a\u000aThis new communication concept helps offline retailers bring excitement back to the store and create a true digital generation shopping experience while also increasing in-store conversion and traffic. Above all, it gives offline retail the ability to compete with online on equal terms \u2013 wynsh generates never before known pre-point-of-sale intelligence for physical retailers and establishes a sustainable and long-term communication channel based on extensive shopper profiles.

VKarmaBox connects physical retailers and consumer products manufacturers to their consumers in a whole new way.\u000a\u000aThink about all the natural advantages online retailers have from monitoring customer behavior, measuring customer sentiment and marketing to drive "walk-ins" at a low comparative cost. We enable physical retailers and those who sell through them to get the same for their shelves, stores and staff. There is no need to do mystery shopping, street marketing or retail audits for any retailer or CPG brand that uses KarmaBox.\u000a\u000aConsumers enjoy a mobile rewards program, connecting with their favorite places and product discovery for the real world.\u000a\u000aWe believe that physical retail is here to stay even if online progresses. The real disruption will be in how software will enable physical retail more and more to compete in a tech enabled world.

Vshopkick was founded in June 2009 by [Cyriac Roeding](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/cyriac-roeding),  [Jeff Sellinger](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-sellinger), [Aaron Emigh](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/aaron-emigh), and is funded by [Kleiner Perkins' iFund](http://www.kpcb.com/initiatives/ifund/), [Greylock Partners](http://www.greylock.com) and [Reid Hoffman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman), founder of LinkedIn, and investor in Facebook and Zynga, and [Ron Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Conway). \u000a\u000ashopkick [bridges the worlds of mobile and physical retail](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218157). In August 2010, shopkick launched the first mobile application that hands consumers rewards and exclusive deals at shopkick's national retail partners simply for walking into thousands of stores and malls. shopkick created a new location technology that allows the app to verify the user is actually present inside a store (GPS is too inaccurate for that). shopkick broadcasts an inaudible audio signal at a high-pitch frequency that can be picked up by a smartphone's microphone, either through the store's existing music system or through a small transmitter.

Tags are typically positioned at the Point of Decision (in a store, on a shelf in front of a product). A typical product story would include detailed technical specs, instructions, tips, FAQs, videos and the social media activity around the product.\u000a\u000aThe Zaptap platform allows retail brands to create and manage product profiles very easily, activate tags (NFC or QR), track sophisticated consumer behavioural metrics and push customized incentives to selected customers.

VConsumers struggle to use gift cards to get meaningful gifts and often the cards go unused ($100B issued each year and 30% are not redeemed). \u000a\u000aRetailers want people to use the cards more often. Why? Because, on average, consumers spend ~17% more than the card balance when making purchases. Likewise, consumers convert at a much higher rate online when offers and coupons are available. Combining offers with gift cards give the consumers and the retailers more value in a much more likely transaction. Revenue is generated from commissions on sales.\u000a\u000aThe impact of CardSpur is two-sided. Consumers often leave gift cards unused due to oversight or not being motivated to use the cards. Redeeming the cards for them unlocks the value and fulfills the intent of gift-giving. Retailers need gift cards to be redeemed. Unused gift cards are a liability to retailers. Redemption moves the value of the card from a liability to revenue (and often above the value of the original card purchase). Combining these outcomes creates economic stimulus.

Inspired by work carried out by Professor Roberto Cipolla at Cambridge University, Metail has since filed patents, raised over £2m in funding and built a highly skilled team dedicated to solving the problem of finding the right fit when shopping online. \u000a\u000aMetail aims to become the global body shape and visualisation experts.  Metail can change the way people view body image and clothing by empowering users to dress for their own personal shape rather than for the projection of the \u2018ideal\u2019 form.

They collect and analyze geo-enabled data to determine the best placement of music and other product in retail, concert, and tour environments. By Q4 2012, they will add streaming and download service to their platform.\u000a\u000aTheir niche is developing outstanding entertainment product as P&D deals for nonprofit entities whose profits go to support charitable causes.

VShoeJitsu is a new, potentially disruptive way to think about retail browsing. \u000a\u000aWhen people are shopping online, there\u2019s often too much choice. Filtering can typically get you down to a few hundred items, but what do you do after that? People need ways to break these complicated decisions down into a series of smaller ones. This is very much what we do anyway when we are trying to pick out one item from a list, only we don\u2019t often do it formally. \u000a\u000aShoeJitsu helps you take a list of items you are interested in and breaks it down into small decisions and then aggregates the results and ranks them for you, specifically with shoes.\u000a\u000aIt does this by showing you two shoes at a time and then having you pick which you like better and showing you two more based on that decision. By aggregating your decisions and everyone\u2019s decisions, over time ShoeJitsu can learn what you and what everyone likes. \u000a\u000aObviously this doesn\u2019t work with every type of decision. It does work particularly well with retail products like shoes and handbags. This is a good place to start because people bought $8 billion worth of shoes last year online.\u000a

VImagine you're standing at a checkout, holding what you want in your hand.\u000a\u000aSomeone offers you a discount. You take it - right?\u000a\u000aThat's what Flubit does: creates better offers for people on things they\u2019ve decided to buy.\u000a\u000aFlubit is a new, demand-driven marketplace that turns online shopping upside down. We\u2019ve created a platform for users to demand the exact products they need and want, and we create a unique offer just for them through our nation-wide registry of retailers. \u000a\u000aWe believe in consumer emancipation. We don\u2019t believe in stuffing inboxes with offer after offer for products people don\u2019t want - we believe in creating real offers for things they\u2019ve already decided to buy.\u000a\u000aWe also don\u2019t believe in crushing retailers with 50 or 80 per cent commissions.\u000a\u000aBy abandoning the traditional commission-based model and replacing it with a 21st-Century approach, Flubit delivers real online sales to retailers and real offers to online shoppers at the same time.\u000a\u000aWe let our users voice their demands, and turn those demands into sales for our retailers. \u000a\u000aLaunched by Bertie Stephens and Adel Louertatani in April 2011 as the world's first true demand-driven marketplace, Flubit.com is set to re-launch in September 2012. \u000a\u000aWith offices just off Hoxton Square in London, Flubit is backed by a group of private investors including Patrick Perez, former CEO & Chairman of Neuron Data/Blaze Software and Erik Fullstrom as an advisor and seasoned technology start-up investor.\u000a

VCleaning Up on the Internet -\u000aA Business That Sucks\u000a\u000a\u000aA brand new internet based business is set to clean up with vacuum cleaner sales online.\u000a\u000aThe founder of the company has had an interest in vacuum cleaners since an early age and could often be found in electrical shops picking up all the latest literature which inevitably ended up being cut up for scrap books. Later in life he started a collection of vintage vacuum cleaners \u2013 mostly recollections of his childhood. The latest chapter in the story is the formation of an exciting website offering machines at heavily discounted prices.\u000a\u000aThe innovative company Cheapvacuumcleanersonline.co.uk boasts premium quality machines at an affordable price. Company Founder Glen Twamley said \u201cI am very pleased to be to be showcasing all these cleaners on one website location, and in a way that\u2019s easy for the online consumer to search and shop for these products. Everything we carry is from the leading manufacturers, often with as much as 50 percent off\u201d. He went on to say \u201cwe also offer free delivery throughout the United Kingdom\u201d.\u000a\u000aHaving worked in retail himself, Mr. Twamley knows only too well how little product training some store staff receive on the goods they are supposed to be selling. This results in customer\u2019s questions not be answered accurately, and sometimes the mis-selling of products. He prides himself in being able to say \u201cVacuum cleaners are our business. We sell nothing else\u201d.\u000a\u000aRetail buying becomes much less of a chore when everything you need is online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Anyone who wants to save money on their next vacuum cleaner can just drop by their website and view all the bargains at the click of a button.\u000a\u000aCheap Vacuum Cleaners Online has its headquarters in Taunton, Somerset, and if a vacuum cleaner is what you are looking for, you can be sure to find it on the new website.\u000a\u000aFor more information, visit www.cheapvacuumcleanersonline.co.uk\u000a

At the time, few other retail jewelry websites offered direct sales to the public via the online forum.\u000a\u000aThe company ethos is to provide the best selection and quality of wedding bands at extremely affordable prices. As WeddingRings.Net is an e-commerce only enterprise, the company is able to offer top quality jewelry lines at a fraction of the cost of our bricks and mortar competitors, due to the fact that the company has fewer overheads.\u000a\u000aThe company works directly with manufacturers and designers in the USA and internationally to create some of the most diverse and unique wedding bands available to modern couples. WeddingRings.Net also offers a direct link between couples and designers in order to create personalized wedding bands.\u000a\u000aThe company offers express shipping nationally and world wide. This had assisted with the development of the '11th hour wedding rings' service the company offers. All products shipped to customers in the continental US are placed on overnight delivery, which means that rush orders are constantly met.\u000a\u000aWeddingRings.Net also offers a unique lifetime guarantee on a number of the product lines sold. Regardless of whether the rings are lost, damaged, stolen or simply don't fit the wearer any more, replacement rings can be obtained at no additional cost.

VVerisize is a virtual apparel size advisor for online retailers to help their customers get always the right size when they buy clothes online.  The size matching is based on the unique silhouette of a person, takes a few seconds and doesn´t require knowing body measurements.\u000a\u000aThe technology can be integrated in any online store to make things easier for consumers and take out the risk of buying clothes online while helping online retailers to reduce fit-related returns and increase their online sales.  \u000a\u000aHow does it work? \u000a\u000aTo know your size for the garment you want to buy, you must insert your parameters: height, weight, age and body type (anonymously, no registration required).\u000a\u000aHow does this actually work?\u000a\u000a1.	You insert your parameters\u000a2.	The tool processes the data to create your virtual silhouette\u000aQ: How does it know my body measurements?\u000aA: Thanks to the study run by engineers (Centre de Visió per Computador, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona) who analyzed anthropomorphic characteristics of over 50,000 people of different body shapes applying algorithms and multiple regression techniques, achieving high accuracy.\u000a\u000a3.

VAsternotes is a cloud-based mobile app development and services startup focused on the thrift,resale and secondhand marketplace.\u000a\u000aVarious mobile shopping apps serve retail shoppers with bar code scanning, reviews, price comparisons, recommendations, voting and picture sharing.  There are also some single purpose thrift shopping apps with features like maps and directories.  But when a mom couldn\u2019t find a mobile app to meet many of the needs relevant to thrift shoppers like her, she designed one.  Asternotes, a cloud-based mobile app development and services startup focused on the thrift, resale and secondhand marketplace, launches its all-in-one mobile app suite for thrift shoppers seeking to make money, save money and help our planet at the same time.\u000a\u000a\u201cAsternotes helps serious thrift shoppers pursue their passion for thrift hunts and discoveries at brick-and-mortar thrift stores with their smartphones,\u201d shares Ronda Polhill, co-founder of the bootstrapped mobile-first start-up.  Asternotes enables community members to accomplish numerous tasks within one mobile application without tapping in and out of several different unrelated apps.  Members can conveniently share pictures and video clips of their thrift shopping finds, ask family and friends for votes and comments, exchange messages within the private social network to resell their item, plan and then map their day of thrift shopping events with one click and manage their inventory.  In addition, users can now use the 3rd Insight feature, a consumer focused algorithm-based recommendation engine unique to the app suggesting what matters most to thrift shoppers specifically hunting for used clothing items to resell: should they pick up or pass up their pre-owned discovery?  \u000a\u000aPolhill hopes Asternotes\u2019 purpose and hotlist features reduces used clothing in the solid waste stream by decreasing buyer\u2019s remorse and hasty decisions to toss out recyclable textiles.  Reducing used textiles in the solid waste stream is a dilemma as well as a steady, big market opportunity.  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates over 68lbs of textiles are thrown away by the average citizen in the United States every year, about 5% of our solid waste stream.  \u000a\u000aBesides the environment benefiting when people choose to reduce, reuse and recycle, the resale industry similarly benefits when people choose to donate or resale their used textiles instead of discarding them in everyday trash.   According to the Association of Resale Professionals, resale is a multi-billion dollar a year industry with Goodwill industries alone generating over $2 billion in retail sales from more than 2,500 non-profit resale stores across the U.S. in 2010.  Thousands of other non-profit and for-profit thrift and resale stores collectively generate billions of dollars in the sizeable industry, too.\u000a\u000aAsternotes was founded by mother-daughter pair Ronda Polhill, CEO, app suite designer and author of The R.E.L.I.C.S. Thrift Shopping Method (kindle) and Shalayne Kemp, CTO and sole android developer.   Kemp, the 24-year-old algorithm designer, used her technical skills to integrate numerous APIs into the Asternotes mobile app.  \u000aThe eco-friendly mobile start-up is adding real-time rewards, mcommerce and partnerships with thrift stores and used goods resellers.  \u000a\u000aAndroid smartphone and mobile device users can get started using the mobile app for free by downloading Asternotes at googleplay.com.  The iOS version will be available shortly.\u000a

Admin users have the ability to work mostly independently, since all the tools they need to do their work are in one easy-to-access place. And since every staff member gets their own unique login, can be tracked throughout their day, and can perform management tasks like tracing mistakes and performance evaluation, through the auditing tools provided by the system.\u000a\u000aThe executives or all-level access users, get the benefit of large-scale, aggregate reports which provide up-to-the-minute information about sales, inventory turnover, outstanding invoices, customer accounts, product popularity, expenses, and much more.\u000a\u000aThe most notable advantage provided by this system is the real-time nature of its database. Because everything is tied together into a single, unified system, everything occurs instantly. For example, if a customer sends an email query about their order 30 seconds before it ships out the door, the mail server picks up the message and attaches it to the order in the database. The fulfillment rep will see this appear on their screen and can take action to adjust the order as appropriate, right then and there.

V[**CheckPoints**](http://www.checkpoints.com) is a mobile shopping platform founded by veteran entrepreneur brothers Mark and Todd DiPaola, which launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2010.  CheckPoints can be downloaded [here](http://itunes.apple.com/app/checkpoints/id373392705?mt=8).\u000a\u000aCheckPoints users accrue points which are instantly redeemable for real-world prizes, by checking-in to over a million retail locations across the U.S. and scanning barcodes on advertised products.  CheckPoints launched with several product partners, including BelkinÂ®, EnergizerÂ®, Seventh GenerationÂ® and Tyson FoodsÂ®.\u000a\u000aFor Shoppers\u000a\u000aCheckPoints helps shoppers discover and interact with featured products by leveraging GPS and UPC scanning technologies on smartphones.  Shoppers earn points just by checking in, as they arrive at a store or restaurant.  In many locations, they can earn additional points by scanning barcodes on featured products and by playing bonus mini-games.  Shoppers can instantly redeem their points in the Rewards Store for gift cards, airline miles, or must-have gadgets.  CheckPoints are a universal currency, meaning points accrued from a specific product or place are not limited to redemption from that brand. \u000a\u000aFor Marketers\u000a\u000aExisting location-based services (LBS) have focused primarily on connecting person with place.  CheckPoints adds the missing link â\u20ac\u201c product â\u20ac\u201c to deliver a robust LBS platform that drives shoppers past the initial check-in and into the aisles.  Brands can now drive foot traffic to a specific product and interactively engage the consumer; creating a â\u20ac\u0153virtual endcapâ\u20ac anywhere that product is sold.  \u000a\u000aSeveral brands joined CheckPoints as featured product partners at the launch, including BelkinÂ®, EnergizerÂ®, Seventh GenerationÂ® and Tyson FoodsÂ®.  When shoppers enter a store that carries a partner brand, CheckPoints features their selected products by offering rewards points and interactive content to engage consumers.  Partner brands can customize the product interaction to include specific and timely messaging, recipes, instant coupons or other special deals.\u000a\u000aIn August 2010, CheckPoints closed a $1 million Series A financing round from co-founders Mark and Todd DiPaola.  The brothers founded performance marketing agency Vantage Media in 2002 while PPC marketing was in its infancy. Before age 30, they self-funded and bootstrapped Vantage to #31 on the Inc. 500 list, selling the company (valued at more than $150 million) in 2007.\u000a

Eliminating the paper application in which it's difficult to distinguish applicants, JobOn essentially puts the interview first and helps managers make better, faster decisions about who to bring in for a face-to-face interview and who to hire. \u000a\u000aNo longer do walk-in applicants compete with customers for a manager's attention, nor do seekers have to fill out multiple applications all over town.

VThe Bordeaux Wine Company (BWC) is an internet-based wine retailer and brokerage, and expert in Bordeaux first growth wines. BWC only deals with high quality and high demand Bordeaux wines which become more expensive as they age and reach their "optimum drinking age".. \u000aThrough BWC, investors can add wines to their portfolio before their prices spike, and then enjoy handsome returns when the company's consultants and brokers sell the wines for a profit. \u000a\u000aBordeaux Wines - What are they?\u000a\u000aBordeaux is the epicenter of the world's wine trade and production. It has been producing wine ever since the 8th century. This French city is situated in the country's southwest region, a central part of one of the largest French urban areas; all the major wine producers and wine lovers flock to Bordeaux every year to attend its wine fair.\u000a\u000aThere are more than 8,500 wine producers in Bordeaux, and every year a Bordeaux harvest produces about 700 million bottles. These include everyday wines as well as the most celebrated kinds. Overall, Bordeaux's wine market is valued at 14.5 billion euro. Most of the city's wines are red (in the UK they're known as claret), but there are some exceptions, such as Chateau d'Yquem, sparkling wines, dry whites and rosÃ©.\u000a\u000aBordeaux Wines Investment\u000a\u000aBWC aims to make wine investment as standard as investing in stocks through a broker. The wine bottles are purchased by BWC through the proper Bordeaux brokers and auctions. As is the case in the stock market, one needs a knowledgeable expert in the field to guide willing investors who lack the experience in wine investments. \u000a\u000a

VTyperings.com (May 2011) is a website for creating personalized jewelry online. The company combines traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today's consumer for personalization. In a â\u20ac\u0153NikeID-likeâ\u20ac environment, visitors can type a text, choose from eight divergent typefaces or upload their own design. The rings appear on screen, showing the designs in full 3D. Typerings.com delivers personalized DIY rings in over 30 countries.\u000a\u000aThe website is part of Alphabeth Group, an Amsterdam based start-up. They're  planning to further develop the current website by adding Asian and Arabic typefaces, introducing gems and diamonds, creating a new 'premium' jewelry brand, other 'niche' websites, an iPad/Android tablet app and an innovative retail concept. All based on the platform, developed for Typerings.com.\u000a\u000aNext to developing new concepts, the company wants to focus on sustainability, switching to using solely recycled silver and gold and starting a project with a small mining facility abroad.\u000a\u000aSustainable trend\u000aCustomization is one of the main consumers trends. Advances in technology and the desire for personalized products is driving a huge surge in the number of customizable products available. When given the choice, consumers are sure to enjoy self-created pieces that they can truly call their own.\u000a\u000aLaunched in 1999, Nike iD is still the best example of online customization. Nike ID allows people to engage in creative expression with a concept that is easy to understand, fun to work with and can simply be shared with friends. A quick online scan shows a lot has happened since then: Customized Jeans, Bicycles, Shoes, Books, Sneakers, Puzzles, Handbags, iPhone covers, even Beer bottles can be personalized.\u000a\u000aWhile Jewelry in itself is extremely personal, there wasn't a 'NikeiD for jewelry'. Founder and Angel investor Rik Heijmen explains why: "I've come to know the Industry as extremely fashionable and trend-sensitive on the one hand, but innovation-lacking and tech-phobic on the other hand", Rik Heijmen explains. Because of his advertising background, his ideas have a fresh approach in an Industry that has barely noticed the internet revolution: "We are now combining traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today's consumer for personalization in Typerings.com."\u000a

VKlosetshop is a virtual closet concept that provides a free, easy to use platform for users to access their entire clothing and accessory collection online. Users can upload their clothes (with the free mobile app), create outfits, share with friends, get advice from stylists, assign outfits to a calendar, pack a virtual suitcase, sell items you donâ\u20ac\u2122t want, and â\u20ac\u201c of course â\u20ac\u201c SHOP!\u000a\u000aFor many people, the process of getting dressed every day is painful and anxiety-ridden. Statistically, only 25% of the clothes in oneâ\u20ac\u2122s closets are actually worn. This is due to many factors â\u20ac\u201c sizing issues, style challenges, organization problems, etc. Most people want to look put together but have a hard time creating outfits from their closet on their own. Another problem is the elimination of items that aren't worn. Many people refuse to clean out their closets because clothes are an investment and the only option usually is to throw them in a garbage bag and give them away for free to Goodwill. Packing before a trip can also cause headaches, and many times people forget to bring items or don't have proper outfits created before they put everything in their suitcase. \u000a\u000aKlosetshop allows users the opportunity to view their clothing catalog at the touch of a button to eliminate the headaches associated both with closet organization and style dilemmas. We start by walking each user through the uploading process so its quick, simple, and fun. Then they start building outfits to see what items work together. They can choose whether or not to list certain items "for sale" that are in their closet so people can bid on them in their "klosetshop". Lastly, if the user decides he or she needs to add something new to their collection, they can shop directly through the site.\u000a\u000aWhen the user logs on, they are prompted to input data into a Style Profile. This data - age, zipcode, size, average monthly clothing allowance, favorite stores, etc - will help our participating retailers target specific markets with their ads. \u000a

VFedTax provides TaxCloud, a free sales tax collection, reporting, and remittance service for internet merchants selling tangible personal property (TPP) and digital goods. Our market opportunity is being expanded and accelerated by pending federal legislation that will mandate the collection of destination-based sales tax on all internet purchases.\u000a\u000aThe Problem\u000aIf your state is one of the 45 that have sales tax, your online purchases are, and always have been, subject to sales tax. Online retailers have not been required to collect sales tax because two out-of-date Supreme Court opinions said it would be too difficult, but they also said that once technology can make it easy, Congress should address the issue. TaxCloud shows that collecting sales tax online is now easy, and Congress is now preparing to enact federal legislation.\u000a

Then, her stylist hand-selects pieces for her from designers like Elie Tahari, Diane von Furstenberg, Theory and more, creating four to six outfits with accessories. The box is shipped directly to each member's door and she tries on the outfits at home. Once she has decided which looks to keep, she ships the rest of the pieces back to CakeStyle, paying only for the items she keeps.\u000a\u000aAll clothing and accessories are priced at retail, with boxes valued at about $2,500 to $3,000 each. Shipping both ways, and the stylists' services, are free. CakeStyle has no minimum purchase requirement.\u000a\u000aCakeStyle also has a [style blog](http://www.cakestyle.com/content) where \u000athe team posts about trends, style advice, designers, and other fashion-related content. \u000a\u000aCakeStyle was founded in August 2011 by Cecelia Myers and Millie Tadewaldt, and launched officially in November of that year. In August 2012, CakeStyle announced that it had raised $1M in seed funding from the [Sandbox Advantage Fund](http://www.sandboxindustries.com).

VGreeting Cloud delivers real, paper greeting cards to customers based on events that they schedule throughout the year. It is designed to provide a more streamlined approach to shopping for greeting cards instead of physically going to the store or using other large online retailers.\u000a\u000aThe value of the service to consumers is primarily convenience in a couple of forms. First, the service removes the need to visit a grocery or drug store in order to purchase greeting cards. These stores often have large aisles of cards and it is time-consuming to look through all of them. The second convenience factor is the sort of "set it and forget it" effect. What the service allows consumers to do is setup all of the different special occasions in their lives (birthdays, weddings, Mother's Day, etc.) months in advance, select the cards they want for those events, and then not think about it until Greeting Cloud ships them the card a few days prior to the event or whenever the customer chooses.\u000a\u000aThe functionality of the service from a user\u2019s perspective is straightforward. Users are given an event-based approach to shopping. All interactions in the web application are in the context of either an \u201cevent\u201d (e.g. birthday, Christmas, anniversary, etc.) or a \u201cdelivery\u201d (e.g. 13th birthday, Christmas 2012, 2 days before 2013 anniversary, etc.) which serves to maintain focus on one task at a time.\u000a\u000aGreeting Cloud is priced using a subscription model with different price tiers based on the number of cards allotted per month. The subscription model was selected to enable a smooth and efficient experience, free from shopping carts or long checkout processes common in most online retail sites. The effect that the subscription model achieves is that customers essentially pay in advance for a certain number of greeting cards which they can schedule to be delivered whenever they wish.\u000a

VFuel Your Fashion Online started as an eBay shop selling shoes, it has since grown to become one of the largest online retailers in the clothing, footwear and accessories sector.\u000a\u000aFYFO is a family business started in August 2007 by Martin & Monica Lott. The business now occupies a 5000 square foot fulfilment centre in Norwich and stocks 80+ brands including Gola, Geox, Homeys, Rockport and Wrangler. We receive new deliveries several times a week so the stock is always up to date.\u000a\u000aWe know that customers sometimes struggle to find their size or style on the high street and so in addition to our core range we also stock many of the more difficult to find sizes such as women\u2019s size 9 and brands which are popular on the continent but under-represented in the UK. We are delighted to be launching a new clothing range in the summer of 2012.

All of our products are the exact fragrance or perfume that you would find at your local department store or salon. How do we sell them at such low prices? Bulk buying, low overhead and smaller margins allow us to pass the best perfume deals on to you. Many other merchants will sell you product spoofs manufactured in China and other overseas markets. They may look like, and sort of smell like, originals but they are not. We guarantee that all of our products are Name Brand Originals.

VI am a California Real Estate Broker, Self-storage owner/operator who enjoys interacting with people.  I love to learn what people do and I love to learn what people like.\u000a\u000aNot only do I sell real estate but I also manage thirteen self-storage properties.  I try to train, motivate, and inspire my employees.  I have always been in a retail environment that focuses on sales.  I find the aspect of what people need and what people want and actually what people spend their hard earned money on very intriguing.  Time is a very important ingredient when it comes to spending money.  In a business cycle you have to take in consideration terms like "seasonal" and "quarterly" and you always have to track the sale with historic statistics to predetermine what kind of day, month, quarter or year your performance will perform.  It is never a guarantee but with history and knowing which month you can eliminate some risk.  Business has always been very competitive to me and my employees.  I always try to recruit people that are competitive and enjoy the nature of a game.  People who love to play games are usually very competitive in self-worth and love to win.  They feel good about the accomplishment or goal they accomplished.  Sales is a huge part in everyone's life.  The game of life.

Visit https://flippa.com/3001757-marketplace-site-that-connects-individual-online-stores-to-1-checkout-pr-1-site for more information.\u000a\u000aThink of a shopping mall...each individual store is connected to each other by being in the same complex. Each store has their own brand, store owner, promotions etc. This is exactly what Gouniq has created in an online environment. The main difference is that at Gouniq you can buy from multiple stores windows from around the world in 1 checkout.\u000a\u000aGouniq connects stores together so they can be easily discovered, browsed and purchased from using one checkout.\u000a\u000aWhat is Gouniq?\u000agouniq.com connects individual stores into a global shopping marketplace, while maintaining each retailer's brand, marketing strategy and unique look. Each store is linked to the same checkout allowing buyers to browse, subscribe and purchase from many stores in one location. Gouniq is the modern-day worldwide shopping centre.\u000a\u000aGouniq hard-launched in June 2013, the website can be viewed here: www.gouniq.com. Since launching we have quickly grown to over 80 stores from 7 countries.\u000a\u000aHere is a short video we put together showing some of the sites functionality: http://vimeo.com/60972949\u000a\u000aA new type of online MARKETPLACE\u000a\u000aGouniq.com empower retailers to:\u000a\u2022Setup and design an online store with no coding or design skills\u000a\u2022Connect stores with others in a online shopping centre environment\u000a\u2022Sell and promote to an instant customer database\u000a\u2022Promote a store to an external audience (outside of Gouniq)\u000a\u2022Share a checkout with other stores\u000a\u000a\u000aBy merging both store builder and marketplace as one solution we were able to replicate the experience of shopping from a shopping centre online. This solution works for the following reasons:\u000a\u2022Retailers receive more product exposure as stores share and launch to instant customers (like a shopping centre)\u000a\u2022Retailers can accurately represent their brand to customers\u000a\u2022Retailers can market their store internally and externally\u000a\u2022Buyers can search and buy from many stores in one location\u000a\u000a\u000aGouniq benefit to Consumers\u000a Gouniq mixes the eclectic shopping experience of a shopping centre, with the convenience of shopping from online stores from all over the world. Like a shopping centre Gouniq provide extensive product choice and the convenience of purchasing from up to 5 individual stores at one time.\u000a\u000aGouniq benefit to Retailers\u000a Retailers can accurately represent their brand, while optimizing product exposure to customers.

VA Real Estate Information Marketplace.\u000a\u000aStreetSine is an information marketplace that leverages innovative web-based technology to bring buyers and sellers together in an intelligent way. It is part search engine, part research library, part organizer, part marketing platform, and part town square.\u000a\u000aThe genesis of the idea for the company came when some Singaporean and American entrepreneurs found each other, by serendipity, on the Internet. They discovered that they shared a common vision: to organize disparate information from around the community in a logical way that helps busy people make intelligent decisions when it comes to purchasing homes, searching for rentals, or buying retail goods and services.\u000a\u000aAt StreetSine, we believe that Singapore, of all the worldâ\u20ac\u2122s international cities, is the most attractive place to launch an information marketplace. Singapore, itself, is well-organized, self-contained, and multi-cultural. In addition, the Singaporean government has created a transparent environment where consumers and businesses can flourish together. With these characteristics already in place, it is possible to map the many bits of retail information floating around Singapore into a succinct and organized marketplace in cyberspace.\u000a\u000aAn information marketplace, like StreetSine, would not have been possible a few years ago. Now, by combining large data sets, supercomputing, and newly-developed web-based software, StreetSine can give individuals insight into the retail consumer market previously unavailable or difficult to find. At the same time, businesses have the opportunity to aid consumers who are poised to buy because they are well-informed.\u000a\u000a\u000aMajor Features.\u000a\u000a\u000aVertical Search engine. One goal of StreetSine is to reduce the time that you need to search the Internet for relevant information on real estate and retail businesses. A general search engine, like Google or Yahoo, generates a random search. It leads to a URL that then requires you to search through the website in the hope of extracting pertinent information. When you are looking for specific information on housing or retail businesses, finding results in a general search engine is random, time-consuming, and often fails to yield sufficient information. It is also difficult and cumbersome to compare and contrast information from different websites.\u000a\u000aAt StreetSine, we take the view that part of our role is to collate information from the community so that your search can be more precise and efficient. Consequently, StreetSine is not a general search engine but a micro-search engine. Using search windows, graphs, overlays, drop-down lists, and a map, you can very quickly access, organize, and analyze massive quantities of information that have been collected by StreetSine.\u000a\u000aResearch library. Unlike retail information that you read in todayâ\u20ac\u2122s newspaper and throw into the recycling bin the next day, information gathered on StreetSine creates a historical record that can be easily recalled. As a result, you now have a trusted site where you can research property trends, property listings, and businesses. For example, you can instantaneously create a graph that compares inflation with interest rates and housing prices for a specified period of time. Or you can look at historical price trends for a particular property type. Or compare a new property listing with recently transacted properties of similar characteristics. Or identify a neighborhood to buy a new home. Or find an interior designer or accountant that matches your needs. Or compare and contrast restaurants for a Saturday night outing. The list of things that one can research on StreetSine is very long, and everything is in one place.\u000a\u000aOrganizer. In an information marketplace, it is essential for you to be able to process large quantities of micro-data so that you can make an informed decision. This must be done quickly, efficiently, and should draw on as many sources of information as possible. We believe the key to making an intelligent decision is organizing information that is not readily available to most people. Therefore, we have developed several innovations that form what we call the Community Positioning System (CPS). This system or platform consists of several features that organize vast amounts of information. There is a map, which serves as a visual aid and the primary reference point for everything performed on the site. The map acts as a cyber-desktop that allows the user to do his work while reaching for a pencil (MyControl Panel), a notebook (MyOrganizer), or a set of reference materials (MyResearch).\u000a\u000aMyControl Panel is a permanent fixture located on the right side of the map. From there, you can access property listings, price trends, research, business listings, rating surveys, forums, and post listings.\u000a\u000aMyOrganizer is the equivalent of an online notebook in which you can store and print information that pertains to your search and research. It is similar to an Internet shopping cart, only you add free information, instead of products, into the â\u20ac\u0153cart.â\u20ac\u000a\u000aMyResearch is an interactive feature that allows you to construct graphs and browse charts, lists, and Heard on StreetSine. In addition, MyResearch is linked to other features in the CPS. For example, if a business uploads a promotion into its business listing, it will appear in Heard on StreetSine. Or, if you make a comment in one of the pop-up windows on the map, it will link to the appropriate category in Heard on StreetSine.\u000a\u000aNone of these features in the CPS requires refreshing the page. Page refreshing is a waste of time that detracts from the task at hand.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, CPS is designed to make it easy for you to toggle back and forth between features without losing your grasp of the overall picture. MyOrganizer and MyResearch slide in and out of the viewing screen so that it is easy to move from the map to research to listings and back to MyOrganizer.\u000a\u000aMarketing platform. StreetSine provides opportunities for buyers to find sellers that will best meet their needs.\u000a\u000aOn the property front, the content and technology on the site make StreetSine a superior platform for looking for homes. The site is interactive and generates qualified leads for listing agents by matching them with interested buyers or renters. The key to doing this is our superior search engine. Functions like nearby listings increase the probability of potential buyers finding the right listings. Functions like comparables help define the search so that when a buyer contacts the listing agent, he has done his homework and is ready to buy. That means a shorter period of home viewings, faster closings, and less house-hunting drama.\u000a\u000aOn the business front, StreetSine offers owners a superior way to increase their web presence. The site provides retail businesses with a comprehensive and interactive listing platform to market their products. Not only can businesses customize the listings to support their marketing goals, they can also update them 24/7 to reflect product launches, promotions, or other information they wish to convey to consumers. On the flip side, consumers can easily identify and locate the businesses with whom they want to do business.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, StreetSine provides businesses with multiple channels to get their message out to an audience that is already searching for their goods and services. These channels include the search engine, business listings, links to the promotion section in Heard on StreetSine, instantaneous information feeds to subscribers, and Nearby Business Listings.\u000a\u000aTown Square. StreetSine employs Web 2.0 techniques to encourage user participation and collaboration, much like one would find among friends or in a town square. When you visit StreetSine, please contribute to the collective wisdom of all users by rating and evaluating businesses, exchanging neighborly advice on Heard on StreetSine, and by helping to create the StreetSine Quality Index (SQITM).\u000a\u000aSQITM is a StreetSine innovation that measures the quality of amenities, such as public transport and grocery stores in the different neighborhoods, for each consumer. For any location on the map, the index gives a personalized number rating based on your preferences, certain neighborhood statistics, proximity of the amenities, and fellow user ratings. The SQITM is calculated on the fly so that wherever you go on the map, you see an SQITM that takes into account your priorities. The SQITM is very helpful for people unfamiliar with a particular neighborhood or for those who are looking to compare and contrast different neighborhoods.\u000a.\u000a\u000aThe Name\u000a\u000a\u000aThe inspiration for StreetSine came from our belief that it is possible to organize disparate information from around Singapore in a way that helps busy people make intelligent decisions when it comes to purchasing homes, searching for rentals, or buying retail goods and services.\u000a\u000aThe name StreetSine is a play on the noun â\u20ac\u0153street signâ\u20ac and reflects who we are and what we would like to accomplish.\u000a\u000aThe origin of Street in StreetSine\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, we are about improving the publicâ\u20ac\u2122s access to information about real estate, small businesses, and neighborhoods. We do not stop with national or district statistics. Instead, we make every effort to drill down, collecting and displaying information that helps people understand home price movements, amenities, and retail services at the street level, where they live. Therefore, we put the word â\u20ac\u0153Streetâ\u20ac in our name to convey our commitment to collecting information at the street level.\u000a\u000aBut that is not the only reason we included Street in our name. If you think about it, streets connect the community. We hope that our site plays a similar role. To this end, we have included Web 2.0 applications like Heard on StreetSine and the StreetSine Quality IndexTM in an effort to encourage you to share your knowledge with your neighbors. By sharing information, all of us will have a better understanding of the property market, our neighborhoods, and the retail services that impact our lives every day.\u000a\u000aThe origin of Sine in StreetSine\u000a\u000aWe all know life is full of ups and downs.\u000a\u000a\u000aMarkets go up and markets go down. The road ahead is not straight, but instead it is curved with blind spots.\u000a\u000aWe cannot eliminate these curves. However, by being better informed, we can begin to smooth those ups and downs and make them, at the individual or street level, more predictable, like that of a sine wave.\u000a\u000aFrom our days studying trigonometry, we learned that sine waves can be found in many fields, including math and physics. We also learned that we can write an equation to represent a sine wave: y(t)=A*sin(wt+Î¸), where t is time, A is the amplitude of the wave, w is its frequency, and Î¸ is the phase.\u000a\u000aStreetSine is dedicated to writing equations that make better sense of the information that is floating around the property market and the community, so that the ups and downs that impact our personal decisions look more like a sine wave than a chaotic hodgepodge of squiggly lines.\u000a\u000aStreet and Sine together as StreetSine\u000a\u000aStreetSine is a natural name for us, as it describes what we do. We are an information marketplace. We help people analyze information at the street level, by incorporating their input with other sources of data, in an effort to provide the clarity and predictability of a sine wave. Hence, our motto is Follow the Sine!\u000a\u000aSummary\u000a\u000a\u000aAt StreetSine, we believe that an information marketplace can serve an important purpose in the community. This site can help buyers make intelligent choices while, at the same time, generating leads for sellers. Given todayâ\u20ac\u2122s Internet standards and broadband penetration, it is now possible to create an organizing force around those disparate bits of information floating in the community and in cyberspace. It is our mission to help organize that information into ways that are meaningful for you, so that you can make decisions with as much information as possible.\u000a

VFeedvisor is a leading Repricing Solution for E-Commerce Marketplaces with a mission to transfer the complexity of repricing decision from a human to computer algorithms.\u000a\u000aProfessional retailers selling via Amazon and other marketplaces need to ensure that they are providing competitive prices all around the clock. Feedvisor Repricing Platform enables retailers to fully manage pricing of their inventory to optimize their sales and profit margins. Feedvisor Repricing Software analyzes prices and price changes that retailer' competitors are charging per product product, and then adjust the retailer's inventory prices in a wholly automated way.\u000a\u000aFeedvisor Amazon Repricer is a web based solution, that means retailers are not required to install anything on their computers.\u000a\u000aPrior to Feedvisor launch Amazon sellers used to rely on a range of primitive repricing software packages that demanded from sellers to pre-program repricing rules upfront. However while it was sufficient in the early days, this approach started to generate inferior results as Amazon Marketplace platform evolved and became more sophisticated in ranking sellers. In E-Commerce Marketplaces such as Amazon, Buy.com and Sears retailer's sales volume tied to retailer's ability to hold what is called a BuyBox - a top ranked position among offers for a given product. Each retailer has different rating on each marketplace and the Marketplace grants the BuyBox only to a retailer with optimal combination of seller' rating and product pricing.\u000a\u000aFeedvisor Repricing Solution came to enable retailers to manage their operations in an increasingly sophisticated marketplace environments. Based on artificial intelligence computer technology of a kind typically used in financial markets, Feedvisor algorithms learn each and every situation and take the necessary action, emulating a human decision making. For example, Feedvisor Repricer is capable to detect patterns such as price war or on contrary a signal by a competitor to raise prices.\u000a\u000aFeedvisor highly-scalable cloud-based solution analyzes millions of data points and then applies its unique repricing algorithms in a continuous quest to improve client's sales and profit margin. It is not surprising therefore that Feedvisor's repricing solution generates an astonishing ROI to its clients on the very first month of use.

VETS Retail LabÂ© provides the most complete infrastructure for unmanned, automatic and objective audience measurement and analysis of in-store shopper behavior.\u000a\u000a\u000aBusinesses now have the choice of a huge diversity of in-store communication tools where the choice is not always made on the most profitable or efficient onces. Furthermore, there is an increasing pressure on the creation of an optimal budget effort. ETS Retail Lab Â© transforms the tombola of selecting instore communication tools into a balanced and measured palette of instore marketing tools where the selection is based on reliable and insightful statistics rather than gut-feeling, the cheapest or most expensive ones or even random choices!\u000a\u000aCurrent research methods are intrusive to the shopper who doesnâ\u20ac\u2122t want to wear sensors, give interviews or being stalked otherwise. Besides the fact that the intrusiveness of these methods skews the results â\u20ac\u201c which shopper will purchase or even look at hammeroid creme when being observed? â\u20ac\u201c the methods also fail in terms of sample size, precision, scalability and lead time. In addition, they are typically very expensive. ETS Retail Lab Â© drastically change the parameters here.\u000a\u000aShopper research with ETS Retail Lab Â© is, relatively cheap, provides huge sample sizes, typically hundreds of thousands of samples, is highly scaleable to any number of stores and delivers accurate measurements. Moreover the method is completely un-intrusive while fully protecting the privacy of shoppers going beyond the Esomar Guidelines.\u000a\u000aOur methodology consists of placing tiny sensors, built-in or stand-alone, which measure attention, viewing quality, age, gender and even interaction with products. This is done with a variety of sensors, most of which operate on the basis of real-time video. In addition we can measure shoppers taking and putting back products.\u000a\u000aData is measured directly, 24/7 and uploaded to a sophisticated data warehouse with a variety of reports and analytics tools. From the â\u20ac\u0153dynamic dashboard reporting and in-depth analyses are carried out. ETS Retail Lab Â© allows crossing behavioral statistics with a host of dimensions such as message, display-type, position in the store, sex, age, day of the week, distance to the object. We also allow relevant data files from other sources to be uploaded and compared to behavioral data, such as cash register transactions, weather conditions and costs of POS Tools or messages on a digital signage network.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat is the profile of your audience?\u000aBasic indicators that are registered by default:\u000a* Presence in terms of volume and duration\u000a* gender * Age categories: a senior, adults, young adults and children.\u000a* Distance from viewer to object\u000a* awareness and viewing with a resolution of 100ms intervals\u000a* taking and putting back products\u000a\u000aWhen the costs of the POS materials, messages or instore communication tools are known, ETS Retail Lab Â© reveals\u000a- what is the ROI of each POS display or ad on a digital signage network?\u000a- which POS materials score in which target groups (are you reaching the right audience?)\u000a- the ideal position of POS tools in terms of position in the store and distance to the viewers\u000a- the lifetime/ aging curve of attention, when do shoppers get accustomed to- and filter out the message or display?\u000a- what are the ideal days and time ranges to buy advertising space (for digital content)?\u000a- what is the profile of your shoppers in terms of age and gender?\u000a- which ad works best, getâ\u20ac\u2122s most attention of the right audience?\u000a\u000aKnowing these performance indicators instore marketing managers can easily compile the ideal combination of instore communication tools that deliver the highest ROI and that hit the right audience. They can even predict it before rolling it out!\u000a\u000aNo privacy issues! Faces of shoppers are not stored and no personally identifyable information is stored in any way. ETS Retail Lab Â© goes beyond the Esomar Guidelines with regard to respecting shoppersâ\u20ac\u2122privacy.\u000a\u000aETS Retail Lab Â© is ideal for:\u000a- a/b testing,\u000a- pre-testing\u000a- continuous research\u000a- intelligent aggregation of data across different measuring methods (sensors)\u000a\u000aETS Retail Lab Â© is offered through a hardware/ software as a service model preventing huge upfront investments and costly learning curves while providing high availability and service levels.

VAt the heart of it, The Catch Group, which owns and operates online shopping stores Catchoftheday.com.au, Scoopon.com.au, Groceryrun.com.au, Mumgo.com.au, and Eatnow.com.au are retailers. But they're retailers that were savvy enough, from the outset, to recognise the disruptive force that the internet would have on the sector, and to choose a delivery platform perfectly attuned to the needs of today\u2019s time poor and value conscious shopper.\u000a\u000aFrom garage to $350M in 7 years\u000a\u000aFounded in 2006 by brothers Gabby and Hezi Leibovich, the idea for CatchOfTheDay was born from a desire to bring fun back to shopping. Bored with catalogue-based online shopping sites that were prevalent in the early days of online retail, the Leibovich brothers sought a better way to harness the power of the Internet to give shoppers a compelling reason to buy online. The reason: amazing deals. The how: pioneering the daily deal \u201cflash sale\u201d retailing model in Australia.\u000a\u000aWith word of mouth and social media fuelling demand as customers turned to social networking sites to share their latest buy with friends, the Group quickly expanded into new niche categories with dedicated online shopping stores; building size while at the same time fostering powerful economies around core operations in technology, deal sourcing, warehousing and logistics. This provided the Group with an agile and lean platform to support profitable growth and expansion into new markets, while at the same time maintaining a compelling price advantage. \u000a\u000aIn May 2011, less than five years from founding its first site CatchOfTheDay, the Group received $80M in funding for a 40% share from a consortium of investors including Tiger Global management (investors in Facebook, Zynga and LinkedIn), James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings and Andrew Bassat from SEEK. The deal was ranked by the Internet Deal Book as the 12th largest ecommerce transaction for 2011, and helped open doors to the additional skills and knowledge needed to take the business to the next level.\u000a\u000aRecognising the power of the deal.\u000a\u000aToday, The Catch Group has evolved from its clearance sale roots to offering brands a compelling retail solution to market their goods to a captive 3.5 million member base, which grows by roughly 30,000 every week.\u000a\u000aThe Group regularly receives over 1 million visits to its websites in a day (24 hours), with one item sold across the group every 1 second.\u000a\u000aIts record-setting deals include 220,000 units of Ferrero Rocher chocolates sold in 8 hours and 675,000 Hungry Jack\u2019s $2 meal deal vouchers in 48 hours. Its highest rate of revenue was $1 million per hour on Samsung LCD TVs.\u000a\u000aIn an increasingly competitive marketplace for deals, this gives the Group a huge advantage over other competitors as well as scope to cross-sell and market new initiatives across its sites.\u000a\u000aBuilding towards the future\u000a\u000aThe Catch Group is serious about carving new ground in Australia\u2019s retailing sector, and as such it wants to be recognised as a serious player in retail as a whole, not just the online space. The Group believes that the future of its business won't be about definitions like \u2018group buying, \u2018daily deals\u2019 or \u2018online stores\u2019: it will be about retail, and choosing the best platforms to meet the future needs of shoppers.\u000a\u000aToday, The Catch Group employs more than 800 staff and for financial year 2011/2012 recorded very strong growth in both sales and profit despite considerable investment in new warehousing technologies, senior personnel and strengthening its core operations. The Group has revealed gross retail recepts from its businesses of circa $350M for 2013 financial year and expects to maintain ongoing double-digit growth for many years to come.\u000a\u000aIntent on remaining Australia\u2019s largest online retail group, profitable growth and expanding into new markets will continue to be key themes for the Catch Group as it continues to build out its portfolio of category leading online shopping stores.\u000a\u000aFor more information visit: catchoftheday.com.au, scoopon.com.au, groceryrun.com.au, mumgo.com.au, eatnow.com.au\u000a

VGreen Dot Corporation is a provider of retail-based financial services.\u000a\u000aThe company offers consumers financial products and services through  retailer locations including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, Rite Aid, Kmart, Kroger, 7-ELEVEN, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Smiths and Radio Shack.\u000a\u000aGreen Dot's products include Green Dot MasterCard® and Visa® branded prepaid debit cards and the Green Dot MoneyPak® - a cash processing gateway that provides a way for consumers to load cash to prepaid cards, use cash to make purchases and pay bills, and add cash to a variety of accounts including PayPal. \u000a\u000aGreen Dot is a leading prepaid financial services company providing simple, low-cost and convenient money management solutions to a broad base of U.S. consumers. We believe that we are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States and that our Green Dot Network is the leading prepaid reload network in the United States. We sell our cards and offer our reload services nationwide at approximately 50,000 retail store locations, which provide consumers convenient access to our products and services. Our technology platform, Green PlaNET, provides essential functionality, including point-of-sale connectivity and interoperability with Visa, MasterCard and other payment or funds transfer networks, and compliance and other capabilities to our Green Dot Network, enabling real-time transactions in a secure environment. The combination of our innovative products, broad retail distribution and proprietary technology creates powerful network effects, which we believe enhance the value we deliver to our customers, retail distributors and other participants in our network.\u000a \u000aWe were an early pioneer in the development of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, or GPR cards, and associated reload services, which collectively we refer to as prepaid financial services. GPR cards are designed for general spending purposes and can be used anywhere the cards' applicable payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, is accepted, but, unlike gift cards, can be reloaded with additional funds for ongoing, long-term use. Our GPR cards are issued as Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards and are accepted worldwide by merchants and other businesses belonging to the applicable payment network, including for bill payments, online shopping, everyday store purchases and ATM withdrawals. We believe that we are the leading provider of GPR cards in the United States based on the 3.4 million active cards in our portfolio as of March 31, 2010, which we define as cards that have had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period.\u000a \u000aWe have built strong distribution and marketing relationships with many significant retail chains, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Kroger, K-Mart, Meijer and Radio Shack. These retail chains provide consumers with convenient locations to purchase and reload our cards. In addition, any holder of a GPR card issued by a member of our reload network may reload that card at any one of those locations. Currently, there are over 100 third-party prepaid card programs that use our nationwide reload network to facilitate reloading by their cardholders. In 2009, we entered into an agreement with PayPal whereby its customers can add funds to any new or existing PayPal account through our reload network at all retail locations where we sell our products and services, but to date we have not generated significant operating revenues from our relationship with PayPal. In fiscal 2009, the gross dollar volume loaded to our GPR card and reload products was $4.7 billion, an increase of 67% over fiscal 2008.\u000a \u000aWe have developed a business model with powerful network effects. Growth in the number of our product and service offerings or our network participants, which include consumers, retail distributors and businesses that accept reloads or payments through the Green Dot Network, enhances the value we deliver to all network participants. Our technology platform, Green PlaNET, enables network participants to communicate and complete transactions rapidly and securely through our reload network or third-party payment or funds transfer networks, and is a central component of our network-based business model.

The selection buttons are not intrusive and remain at the top of the browser.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, the user can see a list of participating retailers on the jollywallet website. At present, there are over 10,000 deals from over 3,000 online retailers. \u000a\u000aIf the user chooses the "cash back" option, then a certain percentage of the sale amount is credited to his/her jollywallet account. Once the jollywallet account reaches $10, the user can transfer the money to his/her PayPal account. Currently, this is the only option for redeeming the "cash back" selection.

VCompany Purpose:\u000a\u000aâ\u20ac\u0153NewMediaPlus develops and maintains a strong, cost-effective Internet presence for individuals and small to midsized businesses through 1-on-1 interaction in our retail locations. NewMediaPlus creates additional value to our partners/vendors who operate predominately web-based businesses by offering space within our retail locations.â\u20ac\u000a\u000aProblem:\u000a\u000aA large number of individuals and business owners are intimidated with graphic design, web development, Internet and new/social media marketing and view it as a necessary evil. Furthermore, working with Internet marketers, graphic designers and web developers (service providers) can be very challenging; most keep hours outside of normal business hours, they prefer to communicate via email on their terms, they often make each project out to be more difficult that it really is, they rarely finish a project before an agreed upon deadline, they have full control of the content and rarely provide clients with copies of their work and in some cases they disappear. \u000a\u000aTraditional advertising doesnâ\u20ac\u2122t work like it used to and most companies do not know how to effectively market themselves online or where to start. Currently, some companies elect not to even bother creating an internet presence because they feel it is too much of a hassle! Other companies look within their organization and assign the frustrating tasks of creating and maintaining new and social media accounts/profiles to existing employees. More often than not, these additional responsibilities are not in the employeeâ\u20ac\u2122s job description. \u000a\u000aMost web based businesses only know how to promote themselves online. These businesses are limited to their virtual world reaching a small portion of their target market.\u000a\u000aSolution:\u000a\u000aNewMediaPlus alleviates all of the typical problems companies are faced with by providing cost effective real time solutions to graphic design, web development, internet and new/social media marketing needs to individuals and small to midsized companies. NewMediaPlus offers the highest level of customer service through 1-on-1 interaction in person at our retail locations, over the phone and through online chat with knowledgeable staff members eliminating any intimidation and answering any questions they may have. \u000a\u000aNewMediaPlus starts with 1-on-1 interaction with each client to get a full understanding of their companyâ\u20ac\u2122s business and then develops online assets such as search engine optimized websites and new/social media assets like. Social Media Assets are defined as profiles and/or accounts created on social media and new media platforms. Examples of social media assets are fan pages on Facebook, profiles on MySpace and twitter and channels on YouTube to name a few. Once the assets are in place NewMediaPlus develops a campaign targeting each companyâ\u20ac\u2122s specific demographic. \u000a\u000aNewMediaPlus customer service representatives will be available to assist clients by phone, online through live chat and in person at the retail locations open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Clients will be able to access their information and files by logging into their NewMediaPlus account online or by visiting any retail location.\u000a\u000aNewMediaPlus will enter into agreements and partnerships with vendors to offer their products/services throughout our network and specifically in our retail locations! This is the first time web based businesses have an opportunity to benefit from retail locations since their inception. This opportunity is similar to selling radios and televisions in the first electronic stores and mobile phones in wireless stores. \u000a

VShopping Cart Elite was designed not only to support businesses such as MimoUSA (online wholesalers) or AutoAccessoryStore.com (online retailer) but was also designed to support and fit the needs of other marketplaces online.\u000a\u000aBelow is a small brief of what we mean by fitting YOUR needs, No matter how specific your market place may be.\u000a\u000aThe lack of computer knowledge to build their own website\u000a\u000aLacking knowledge in web design, computer programming, marketing or all the above. \u000a\u000aMany would find cheap solutions through different hosting companies and spend a great amount of money trying to bring the website online. This often resulted in the retailer giving up or just quitting altogether. \u000a\u000aSome retailers would get lured into one of the many website schemes online, where the provider promised the retailer thousands of dollars in profits by going with their (provider's) solution. In conclusion the retailer would come to realize they have lost everything they spent on this solution and as you might expect, experienced a bad vibe of internet retailing. \u000a\u000aA great majority of retailers signed up with variety of different Shopping Cart Providers which couldn't support the MimoUSA 100,000 parts data feed. These Shopping Carts not only lacked in technology to properly categorize all the products. But the automotive industry demands a completely different type of technology which would not only support options for products, but also makes, models and years. To get even more advanced wheel and tire sizes were not even considered. In result the retailers would have no choice but to enter the products one by one which is theoretically possible, but highly impractical. \u000a

VA new way to Buy4Less. No longer do retailers set the price, you Name Your Price.... \u000a\u000aFirstly, you do your research online for that golf product you want to buy. Checkout your favorite online stores both here and overseas. Ask your mates. Buy the latest Golf Magazine. All the stuff you love to do...\u000a\u000aThen go online and visit golf4less.com.au, Australia's golf online marketplace.\u000a\u000aSearch and find the golf product you want to buy, they are all listed on the site with great photos and product descriptions. Choose the right options for you and now the fun starts ...\u000a\u000aYou look at the RRP and then you Name Your Price for the product, not a silly price but an intelligent price based on your research.\u000a\u000aThe Name Your Price offer is sent to multiple retailers. They see your price, they know it's a fair price based on research. \u000a\u000aOther people can also make offers to buy the same product based on your research.\u000a\u000aTwo retailers match your offer and set their Buy4Less price based on this. Another retailer decides on a higher price.  Someone else has Named their Price, $15 lower than yours.\u000a\u000aNow, you have created your very own online marketplace with multiple retailers competing to sell.\u000a\u000aYou edit your Name Your Price offer, reducing it a further $10. \u000a\u000aA retailer accepts this offer.\u000a\u000aNow you have to move quickly, as the text message tells you that this Buy4Less price is available for anyone to buy on the site.\u000a\u000aIt's first come, first served.\u000a\u000aIt's a great price. You know someone else is also interested at a similar price.\u000a\u000aYou simply choose the Buy4Less price that your now completely happy with then go to the checkout and pay for the product. \u000a\u000aThe retailer that sold you the product ships the item directly to you from their store.\u000a\u000aNo auctions, no group buying just connecting you to great bargains from local Australian based retailers wanting to sell at your price. \u000a\u000aIt's a simple new way to Golf4Less.

VShopsy is the place to shop for products discovered on Instagram. \u000a\u000aThe Problem:\u000a\u000aFrom big brands to small boutiques, there are tens of thousands of retailers on Instagram. There are also thousands of fashion bloggers on Instagram who promote products from these retailers, but are unable to monetize from doing so. \u000a\u000aWhen Instagram users want to purchase a product posted by a retailer or fashion blogger on Instagram, they are forced to the retailer\u2019s web-based application only to encounter a tedious and usually-abandoned search for that product. \u000a\u000aThere is currently no efficient process that lets Instagram users purchase products that they come across on Instagram, resulting in retailers losing out on revenue opportunities.  \u000a\u000aThe Opportunity:	\u000a\u000aShopsy is the only platform that lets Instagram users purchase products that they see on Instagram. By building into Instagram\u2019s API, Shopsy will provide the 150+ million Instagram users with a simple product discovery and purchase process. \u000a\u000aOur Solution:\u000a\u000aShopsy lets anyone create content by posting an Instagram photo of a product with a website URL of where the product can be purchased. Shopsy pulls the user\u2019s Instagram social content, including followers, following, likes, and comments. Put simply, Shopsy allows anyone to convert a retailer\u2019s Instagram followers into sales. \u000a\u000aShopsy will also offer its users the ability to search for products or shops.

VInvenQuery provides virtual marketplaces for sellers of unique items.\u000a\u000aRetailers of unique items (antique dealers, thrift stores, etc.) struggle to scale online because populating, hosting and promoting an online store is time and resource intensive. While retailers know that online marketing is vital to increase customer reach, traffic & sales, they struggle to justify the time & money it takes to establish an online presence.\u000a\u000aInvenQuery is the answer.  \u000a\u000aInvenQuery\u2019s web + mobile applications unite dispersed sellers of unique goods to populate a single online marketplace. Retailers that join an IQ marketplace benefit from inclusion in a well-designed, high traffic website, an easy mobile app for uploading their items, and social media sharing tools that showcase products where their customers actively search and share. \u000a\u000aThrough a niche marketplace, multiple retailers can join forces to attract their ideal customers. With our simple mobile app they showcase items on a marketplace, their own site, & their social media networks in seconds. By leveraging social media, IQ helps retailers amplify traditional marketing by driving shoppers to the marketplace. By aggregating sellers of similar items into one online marketplace, IQ creates a go-to resource for an industry.\u000a\u000aIQ is making economic, environmental and social impact serving the first of several vertical markets: the discount home improvement retail industry (e.g. reuse centers). Reuse centers take donations of reclaimed building materials and sell them to fund a variety of social and environmental initiatives, such as Habitat for Humanity\u2019s home building efforts or Reclaim Detroit\u2019s deconstruction job training program. \u000a\u000aCurrently, the $270 million material reuse industry is growing 15% per year, selling less than 5% of all inventories online. Yet 78% of home improvement projects start with an online search. IQ enables reuse centers to market their products where customers are shopping. With the IQ mobile application sellers can display inventories on an IQ marketplace website, their store\u2019s website, and on popular social media sites, in a single workflow. IQ makes it easy for reuse centers to reach more customers with unique inventories, to solicit more donations, and ultimately, to provide valuable social and environmental conservation services to communities across the country. As reused material transactions increase, the IQ platform is poised to integrate with inventory and sales tracking technologies, enabling the capture of valuable transaction and landfill diversion data. \u000a\u000a\u000a

VVisa Europe is a payments technology business owned and operated by member banks and other payment service providers from 36 countries across Europe.  \u000a\u000aVisa Europe works at the forefront of technology to create the services and infrastructure which enable millions of European consumers, businesses and governments to make electronic payments. Its members are responsible for issuing cards, signing up retailers and deciding cardholder and retailer fees.\u000a\u000aVisa Europe operates a high volume, low cost business model that provides services to its members.  Its surplus is reinvested into the business and used to improve capital and reserves.\u000a\u000aThere are 466m Visa cards in Europe while \u20ac1 in every \u20ac6.75 spent in Europe is on a Visa card. Almost 80% of Visa Europe's business is on debit cards and, in the year to September 2012, over \u20ac1 trillion (\u20ac1.02tr) was spent on Visa debit cards. Despite the challenging economic climate, total spend by Visa cardholders grew by 8.0% to \u20ac1.3 trillion. Annual online spending on Visa cards in Europe topped \u20ac200 billion (\u20ac202bn) for the first time in this period and now accounts for more than 20% of Visa Europe\u2019s processed business. \u000a\u000aVisa Europe employs 1,700 people on a permanent basis and we make a concerted effort to attract, inspire and develop capable, committed people from a wide variety of backgrounds to our business. We also invest in higher apprenticeships \u2013 equivalent to 2% of our workforce \u2013 because we believe they are the right way for our business to capture and develop entry level talent.\u000a\u000aSince 2004, Visa Europe has been independent of Visa Inc. and incorporated in the UK, with an exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licence in Europe.  Both companies work in partnership to enable global Visa payments. As a dedicated European payment system Visa Europe is able to respond quickly to the specific market needs of European banks and their customers - cardholders and retailers - and to meet the European Commission\u2019s objective to create a true internal market for payments.\u000a\u000aImportance of security\u000a\u000aEnsuring payment security is one of Visa\u2019s highest priorities. Over \u20ac1billion has been invested in technology and infrastructure over the past six years, building a robust and secure European payments platform from which to deliver the next generation of payment technologies. All Visa transactions are based on the international EMV chip standard which provides the most advanced and widely adopted cryptographic security for payments today. \u000a\u000aWe continue to deliver unparalleled payments safety for consumers, merchants and retailers. Visa has a robust multi-layered approach to security which is proving highly successful in driving down fraud levels. Fraud losses on Visa cards are at an all-time low for the second year running (Europe-wide: 0.04%).\u000a\u000aBenefits for all\u000a\u000aSuccessful payment services bring tangible benefits to both consumers and retailers:\u000a\u000a\u2022	Consumers (speed, control, convenience and security): consumers enjoy a quick, easy checkout experience, with no fumbling for notes or coins, and no need to wait for change. \u000a\u000a\u2022	Retailers (happier customers, increased sales, new efficiencies): retailers can see that their investments in new payments innovations will automatically enable them to benefit. With a quicker, slicker sales experience, customer satisfaction can be increased, queuing times reduced, and resources saved \u2013 and with fewer notes and coins, the costs and complexities of cash handling can be effectively addressed.\u000a\u000a\u2022	Member financial institutions: consumers see the service as innovative, it meets clearly identified needs \u2013 giving members an opportunity to differentiate their brands, strengthen existing relationships and attract the attention of potential customers.\u000a \u000aFor more information, please visit www.visaeurope.com\u000a

Weepii will revolutionize the Internet Retail Industry in Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aThe niche: Last year Puerto Ricans spent $19,000,000 in online shopping, averaging an annual spending of $399 per buyer. However, as of today, 98% of online sales in Puerto Rico come from US based online stores, leaving behind the Puerto Rico retail and wholesale industry with merely a fraction of the remaining 2%. According to the 2002 Economic Census of Puerto Rico, the Island has over 13,700 retail establishments that reported $37 billion in sales that year alone. This information makes it clear that Puerto Rico lacks of an Internet retail industry and its ready for it.

CityOdds Ltd delivers odds via a state-of-the art online platform and allows bettors to quickly place bets or trades on various financial market outcomes over periods from a few minutes to over 1 year.\u000a\u000aThe technology has been developed, tested and operated in the public domain and is built to allow the construction of bespoke financial investments as well as shorter term derivatives and bets. To scale the business beyond that of a Financial Betting Provider, CityOdds seeks to deliver its products directly to the UK and European retail marketplace and via agents and white label providers.\u000a\u000aCityOdds Ltd is unique in that it captures the whole contract production process from specification, manufacture, delivery and support. It is the most efficient way for customers to manufacture bespoke bets and to have complete and instant liquidity in the secondary market.\u000a \u000aCityOdds plans to scale its technology and infrastructure to be able to offer both retail financial betting products and retail derivatives investments to the UK and eventually European customers. \u000a\u000aThe delivery of retail derivatives has, to date, been by the investment banks, asset management companies (buying the derivatives from investment banks) and insurance companies. The delivery of these products has been inefficient and fraught with mis-selling issues. There is a large gap in the market for retail investors to create bespoke products (with or without the input of an advisor) and purchase them directly from the provider. The margins accruing to investment banks are very large and thus offers CityOdds a direct means to generate significant revenue.\u000a\u000a

Once youâ\u20ac\u2122ve optimized your shopping list, you can print it, head to the store with a mobile version, or continue to a retailer's website to research or purchase products.\u000a\u000aGroceries are the largest retail market in the world. The average American household spends over $6,400 per year on food - more than four times the amount they spend on travel.

We believe that consumers should have the same type of tools to help plan a trip they make twice a week: to the grocery store.\u000a\u000aGrocery Server LLC was formed in August 2010 as a joint venture between Qponix and MyGroceryDeals.com, by an international team of retail, marketing and technology veterans.

VZuluTime is innovating and evolving position, navigation and timing (PNT) technologies for wireless networks. The companyâ\u20ac\u2122s patented architecture enables wireless networks to become â\u20ac\u0153location awareâ\u20ac through normal communications traffic that occurs on those networks. Simply by their involvement in a wireless network, smartphones and other networked devices are located and positioned in interior spaces with far greater accuracy, even in distortion-rich environments where GPS signals cannot penetrate.\u000a \u000aZuluTime technology greatly expands opportunities for location-based services in retail, social networks and industrial applications without embedded technology or special rule sets or synchronization. In retail, ZuluTimeâ\u20ac\u2122s location-based solution enables one-to-one marketing to the shopper at aisle-level accuracy. When integrated into the retailerâ\u20ac\u2122s customer loyalty database, shoppers can now opt-in to receive relevant offers and product information triggered by their location and shopping behavior in the store, further combined with current and past purchase patterns and preferences. This level of detail also provides retailers with robust analytics on shopper paths and dwell times, along with opportunities to influence shopper behavior through anticipatory retailing practices.\u000a\u000aZuluTimeâ\u20ac\u2122s software platform is agnostic to network type. Although initially developed for Wi-Fi networks, the technology is equally suited for WiMax, cellular, Bluetooth and other digital radio networks to provide their own reliable positioning services. Featuring rapid deployment, scalability and a low total-cost approach, ZuluTime achieves greater accuracy than traditional positioning techniques, such as GPS, TDOA, and RSSI. \u000a\u000aZuluTime is privately held and was formed in 2006. ZuluTimeâ\u20ac\u2122s co-founder and Chief Architect, Geoff Rhoads, is one of the most prolific inventors in the last fifty years, with over 300 issued patents across a variety of fields.\u000a\u000a

VWalkbase provides retail analytics solutions that allow retailers to measure the impact of marketing on footfall, understand customer behaviour in-store, improve store operations and enable personalized mobile applications via a real-time API.\u000a \u000aThe Walkbase system is able to monitor WiFi-enabled mobile phones and use sophisticated positioning algorithms to estimate the location of these in indoor spaces. The solution can be deployed stand-alone using Walkbase sensors or leveraging WiFi infrastructure already installed in a building. Consumer\u2019s unique Wi-Fi identifiers (MAC addresses) are hashed to ensure data privacy protection.\u000a \u000aOur retail analytics dashboard shows traffic trends by store and, given a larger installation, within departments inside a store. Capture rate (percent of passers by entering) can be measured, along with dwell time by store or zone and proportion of loyal repeat customers. This allows comparisons across time and different stores in a chain \u2013 all valuable information for a store or retail chain manager to identify opportunities to improve customer service and conversions to sales.\u000a \u000aMarketing teams can measure footfall changes in response to general or store-specific advertising campaigns, providing an understanding of whether campaigns are generating traffic. The Walkbase integration with Google Universal Analytics allows our customers to combine data from campaigns with footfall data and view it side-by-side (available in beta). Further, retailers launching mobile applications for their customers can use the Walkbase real-time API to personalise the app experience based on location and (with opt-in) customer profile.\u000a \u000aWalkbase is based in Finland and is an alumnus of the Startup Sauna accelerator at Aalto University. The company has raised seed investment from Finnish and Russian angel investors. \u000a

VDelivery is the single biggest cause of dissatisfaction in online retail, for example 20% of the UK\u2019s 650 million deliveries fail, costing UK retailers alone in excess of £850M per annum in lost revenues and more still in lost opportunity for repeat business.\u000a\u000aOnline Retailers around the world invest heavily in the customer journey and delivery is the only physical contact with their customer, but most online retailers only have visibility until their order is despatched. Due to the complexity and cost of integrating with multiple delivery partners most retailers simply hand over their orders to a carrier and wait and hope the goods make it to their customers.\u000a\u000aScurri is a cloud-based delivery management platform that gives merchants the tools to gain control and operational efficiency. Ease of deployment, flexible work flow combined with real time analytic and status updates, gives the merchant the tools to systematically address the underlying issues leading to delivery failure.\u000a
